ALthough the gender bias decoder python package is free to use, this site's code is not to be used without the express written permission from myself.

## Overview

Gender Bias Decoder is a single page web app that scans inputted text for any unconscious bias. Any problems are highlighted in pink for female bias and blue for male bias. Text free from bias is better for emails, job adverts etc, ensuring that people are not put off by any bias.
